## Get Codes  
This package may be utilized to obtain ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, SNOMEDs, RxNorms, LOINC codes for given disease, drugs or laboratory terms. The codes are obtained using pre-trained model ‘text-davinci-003’. Please make sure to manually review the codes before using them further. I personally always manually review the codes before using them irrespective of the source. Enjoy, and have fun!
